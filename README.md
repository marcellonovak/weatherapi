# weatherapi
A small program I made to track the weather at my house and graph it.
Since github won't allow me to upload the venv folder I used to import all my libraries, here's a small list of the requirements instead.
- An API key from openweathermap.org
- datetime
- requests
- json
- matplotlib
- time
- your coordinates for wherever you want to plot from
And that's really it! Have fun being a huge meteorological nerd.
